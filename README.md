# Portfolio Website

## Theory of Operation

All of the files inside `resources/` are directly hosted and can be accessed via static path through the websites. The files inside `views/` are internally used by Express and EJS to assemble and compile the pages.

`launch.sh` builds the statically served CSS using the LESS compiler from NPM.
